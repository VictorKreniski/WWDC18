 This playground is a representation of a Story in my perspective of looking into the world.
 I am going to show you, in a interactive way, the concept of Diversity and Cooperation.
 
 The creative process to this playground was creating a representation of Human being interaction through music.
 
 The singer, is a sound instrument that represents what we do best, what we are, what we do, the best we have to offer to others.
 
 The sound instrument is a tool to make this representation audible and understandable through music.
 
 The scenario is a Stage, a representation of life, the space where we can express ourselves.
 
 The singers colours represent the diversity and were chosen based on the 1976 Apple Logo.
 
 The harmony is the result of all the sounds put together, creating music. This means when we give what we have in a cooperative and diversity way we are able to create great things.
 
 This playground is also to honor Apple way of dealing with diversity and cooperation.
